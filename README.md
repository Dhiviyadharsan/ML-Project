# ML-Project

# Industrial Copper Grade Prediction Model

# Overview

This project implements a machine learning model to predict the grade of copper based on various industrial data points. The model is trained using a dataset containing historical data on copper ore properties and processing conditions. The Random Forest Regressor is utilized for predicting the copper grade, and the results are evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² score.

# Dataset

The dataset used in this project is copper_data.csv. It contains historical data on copper production and various features influencing copper grade. The key columns in the dataset are:

**id:** Unique identifier for each observation (dropped during preprocessing).
**grade:** Target variable indicating the copper grade in percentage (the value we aim to predict).
**Feature Columns:** Numeric features influencing copper grade, such as:
temperature
pressure
flow_rate
ore_humidity
chemical_composition
mineral_content
And others related to the mining and processing conditions.

# Prerequisites

To run the code, you need the following libraries installed:

pandas
numpy
sklearn
matplotlib
seaborn
pickle
Install them using:
bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn


# Steps in the Code

**1. Import Libraries**
Necessary libraries are imported for data processing, model training, evaluation, visualization, and serialization.

**2. Load and Explore Data**
The dataset is loaded using pandas.read_csv(). Basic information, missing values, and sample rows are displayed to get an understanding of the dataset.

**3. Data Preprocessing**
Unnecessary columns (such as id) are dropped. Missing values are handled appropriately, either by imputing or dropping rows/columns. Feature scaling might be applied if necessary. The target variable (grade) is mapped to a numeric type for regression.

**4. Visualization**
A correlation heatmap is generated to analyze the relationship between features. Scatter plots or pair plots may also be used for visualizing individual feature relationships with the target variable.

**5. Model Training**
The dataset is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split. A Random Forest Regressor model is trained using the training data.

**6. Evaluation**
Predictions are made on the test set. Model performance is evaluated using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R² score. A residual plot might also be included to analyze prediction errors.

**7. Feature Importance**
The importance of each feature in prediction is visualized using a bar plot to understand which features have the most influence on copper grade prediction.

**8. Model Serialization**
The trained model is saved as a pickle file (copper_grade_model.pkl) for later use.

# How to Run

Save the dataset as copper_data.csv in the working directory.

Run the Python script to perform the following tasks:

Load and preprocess the data.

Train the model.

Evaluate the model performance.

Visualize feature importance.

Save the trained model as a pickle file.

# Expected Outputs

**Correlation Heatmap:** Displays relationships between features and helps identify strong correlations with the target variable (grade).
**Model Evaluation Metrics:** Shows performance metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R² score to assess model accuracy.
**Feature Importance Plot:** Highlights which features are most influential in predicting copper grade.
**Serialized Model:** The model is saved as a pickle file (copper_grade_model.pkl), which can be reused for future predictions.
